# WentToursPOM Reservation

Page Object Model is a design pattern to create Object Repository for web UI elements.

Under this model, for each web page in the application there should be corresponding page class.

This Page class will find the WebElements of that web page and also contains Page methods which perform operations on those WebElements.

Here we have one POM for LoginPage and another for FindFlightPage which are calling in TestPage.


Ready Scenarios:

1)TestLogin


Steps:

1)Navigate to  Page

2)Login Page

3)FindFlight

4)Logout using LoginPage


Run the tests:
